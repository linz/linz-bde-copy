bde_copy: Extracts data from BDE files
Version: 1.2.0 (Jan 19 2018)

Syntax: [options] input_file output_file [log_file]

input_file is a BDE crs download file, typically gzip compressed
output_file is the generated data file
log_file holds information about the conversion - default is standard output

To output the data to standard output use '-' as a substitute for output_file
If output is going to standard output, log_file defaults to standard error

  -c xxx   Use xxx as an additional configuration file - this is read
           *in addition* to the bde_copy.cfg file found in the package

  -o xxx   Specifies which field are required in the output file.  Field names
           are specified as name1:name2:name3...
